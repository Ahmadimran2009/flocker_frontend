Our group has chosen to focus on discussions about which drinks should be added to our school cafeteria menu. For instance, we might consider whether options like flavored water or fruit juices should be introduced alongside traditional choices like chocolate milk. By exploring these topics, we aim to engage students in conversations that reflect their preferences and encourage them to share their opinions on beverage options.
